# Introduction

password creates specialized random passwords.  Specifically it creates a nine character
password such that
* the first character is always an upper case letter.
* there is always a lower case letter.
* there is always a digit.
* there is always a symbol taken from the set [!@#$%^&*()]
* all the other characters are taken from the set of lower case letters, digits and symbols.

The placement of a character (other than the first) cannot be ascertained before
hand.
